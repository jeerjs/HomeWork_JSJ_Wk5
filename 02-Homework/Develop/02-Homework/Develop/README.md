- This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

- Uses the [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/) library to work with date and time.

- WHEN the user opens the planner THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar

- WHEN the user scrolls down THEN they are presented with timeblocks for standard business hours

-WHEN the user views the timeblocks for that day THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future

-WHEN the user clicks into a timeblock THEN they can enter an event

-WHEN they click the save button for that timeblock THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
